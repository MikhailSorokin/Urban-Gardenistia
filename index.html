            <p>For nearly 15 years, Ellina Sorokina and Bernadette Williamson worked together at Hardware City, a retail store situated in the heart of Kensington. Built at the intersection of multiple neighboring communities, the company’s prime location allowed for it to become a heavily trafficked site, attracting loyal customers drawn to the store’s affordable prices, the variety of unconventional products sold, and the strong customer service support its employees offered. For many locals, Hardware City was a preferred business providing a positive and convenient shopping experience. What stood out in this store was the Lawn and Garden department, which served as a destination for finding unique and unusual plants or getting advice on how to grow and maintain a beautiful lawn independently.</p>
            
            <p>After joining the company, Ellina and Bernadette channeled their energy into enthusiastically serving the community through their respective fields of retail expertise: Ellina helped manage the Lawn and Garden department, while Bernadette handled the store’s finances and human resources. Although they worked in different departments, they connected quickly over shared values. The two are driven by an interest in retail dynamics, especially the opportunity to make connections and share knowledge with customers, and belief in the power of continued education. Both are avid gardeners who are passionate about plants, art, and design. In their jobs, year after year, they sold customers exceptional planting materials while suggesting novel ideas for how to incorporate them in garden designs. The two grew professionally, engaged with customers, and turned themselves into specialists who now, as a team, can offer high-level expertise from a combined knowledge base of the lawn and garden retail industry, finances, human resources, and communications to to future clients of Urban Gardenistia.  
            </p>

            <p>
           Today, Hardware City is going out of business due to unfortunate circumstances – this institution that served the local community for over 60 years is closing because it was unable to meet the posted requirements to renew its building lease. This event has served as a catalyst for collaboration between Ellina and Bernadette. In order to continue serving Hardware City’s customer base, they decided to team up and open an independent lawn and garden design center that will promote sustainable, scientifically-proven garden practices and techniques appropriate for all ages and skill levels. Taking into consideration the growing environmental awareness in communities around the Chesapeake Bay, strict laws and regulations guiding application of fertilizers and pesticides in Montgomery County, and the growing interest in and movement toward sustainability in the lawn and garden industry, they have crystallized the conceptual profile of the garden center as solely natural and organic.
            </p>

            <p> Ellina and Bernadette are focused on creating a garden center offering a one-of-a-kind selection of natural and organic lawn and garden products and unique artisanal goods, based on their own experience and expertise. Their criteria for choosing products have proven themselves over the years to be safe, convenient, efficient, reliable, ergonomic, and innovative in their gardening applications and artistic value. The center will offer classes, workshops, and demonstrations for gardening, host talks led by professionals on lawn and garden care, and provide in-store consulting services on custom landscape designs. Urban Gardenistia will proudly uphold Hardware City’s legacy, continuing to serve its surrounding communities as a retail mecca for urban landscapers and plant enthusiasts, working at the intersection where the art and science of sustainable garden design meet.
