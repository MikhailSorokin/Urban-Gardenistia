            <p>For about 15 years, Ellina Sorokina and Bernadette Williamson worked together in the retail company, Hardware City, situated in the center of the quiet town of Kensington. It was in an exclusive location, right on the cross roads of all tight-knit neighboring communities. A high traffic of loyal customers was garnered over the years, as they were lured in by the affordable price range on the merchandise and strong customer service support offered by the company. The variety of unconventional products offered in the store was the core component of cultivating a positive shopping experience. For many locals, Hardware City was a desirable and preferable place to shop, and for 60+ years, it served the needs of communities very well. What stood out in this store, however, was the “Lawn and Garden” department, which was an attractive destination to find unique and unusual plants or get advice on how to independently grow and maintain a beautiful, lush lawn.</p>
            
            <p>After joining the company, Ellina and Bernadette channeled their energy to enthusiastically serve the community in two different areas of the retail process:  Ellina was involved in the management of the “Lawn and Garden” department in the store, while Bernadette handled the finances and human resources in the office. They share similar values and are both driven by retail dynamics, social aspects of sharing knowledge through serving customers, and the power of continued education. Both of them are avid gardeners who are very passionate about plants, art and design. In their jobs, they offered customers exceptional plant materials, and helped provide ideas on how to incorporate them in garden designs, year after year. They grew professionally, engaged with customers, and turned themselves into specialists who now, in a duo, can offer high-level expertise in the lawn and garden retail industry, finances, human resources and communications. 
            </p>

            <p>
            Today, Hardware City is shutting down the business under unfortunate circumstances – it was unable to meet posted requirement on renewing the building lease. This event was a catalyst for the collaboration between Ellina and Bernadette. In order to continue the legacy of serving local communities of urban gardeners ranging from all ages and skill levels, they decided on teaming up to open an independent lawn and garden design center that will promote the idea of sustainable, scientifically-proven garden practices and techniques through the learning- gardening approach. Taking in the consideration of several factors, such as the growing environmental awareness in the communities around Chesapeake Bay, strict laws and regulations on applications of fertilizers and pesticides in Montgomery County, and the strong current trends in sustainability in lawn and garden industry, they have crystallized the conceptual profile of the garden center as solely natural and organic. They decided to be focused on creating a garden center with a one-of-a–kind selection of natural and organic lawn and garden products and unique artisanal goods, based on their own experience and expertise. The criteria for choosing products are proven to be safe, convenient, efficient, reliable, ergonomic and innovative in gardening applications, artistic values and wholesome benefits of the chosen products. The center will provide in-store consulting service on designing and implementing landscapes through the custom-design scheme to match the topographic features of the site. Urban Gardenistia will be a garden center where the science of horticulture, inspirational art and sustainable design merge with retail.
